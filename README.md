# Stress Test by Locust

Welcome to our Locust stress test by Locust.

### Required Directories ðŸ˜² 

_Important (please read before run your project)_

The next directories will be used by shortened-url scripts. Make sure you have added them to your local project.
Gitkeep extension inside folders is not used because test could fail by an unrecognized extension and file name

As additional, if you want to execute the shortened-url-redirector.py script, you must run shortened-url-maintainer.py first.
This is because the first one needs to find files inside shortened-urls directory, and the second one is capable to create element inside that

##### Shortened Url Maintainer flow

- shortened-urls
